This project aims to analyse biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations. The National Park Service wants to ensure at-risk species' survival and maintain their parks' biodiversity level. Therefore, the main objective is to understand the species' characteristics, their relationship to the national parks, and their conservation status.

This project scopes, analyses, prepares, and plots data and seeks to explain the findings from the research.
